What is Hellascoin?

Hellascoin is a cryptocurrency based on Litecoin which is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.

    9 minute block targets
    subsidy halves 1M blocks (~17 years)

The rest is the same as Bitcoin.

    500 coins per block
    53 blocks to retarget difficulty

Development process

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Litecoin development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the patch submitter will be asked to start a discussion with the devs and community.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions (see doc/coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable.
Testing

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.
